# 👋 Hi, I'm Keyur Ambekar

### Cloud & Systems Engineer | AWS | Active Directory | Virtualization | Infrastructure Labs

I’m a postgraduate Cloud Computing graduate building hands-on infrastructure across cloud and on-prem environments.

My focus is on designing, deploying, and troubleshooting real systems — combining cloud architecture, Windows Server administration, networking fundamentals, and practical support workflows.

I learn by building labs, documenting problems, and solving them step-by-step.

## 🔥 Core Focus Areas

### ☁️ Cloud Engineering

* AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, Cognito)
* Cloud deployment & configuration
* Identity & access management
* Secure authentication workflows
* Basic microservices deployment

### 🖥️ Systems & Infrastructure

* Windows Server 2022
* Active Directory (Users, Groups, OU, Password Policies)
* Domain Controller + Client VM architecture
* VirtualBox virtualization
* DNS & networking fundamentals

### 🛠 IT Support & Operations

* Account lockout troubleshooting
* Group-based permission management
* Remote access (RDP, Tailscale)
* Lab-based ticket scenario simulations
* System issue documentation & runbooks

### 💻 Development (Supporting Skill)

* Node.js (Foundational)
* MongoDB (Foundational)
* React, Angular (Foundational)
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Development supports my cloud and infrastructure work — not the other way around.

## 🧪 Hands-On Lab Environment

My home lab includes:

* Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller
* Client VM joined to domain
* Active Directory user & group management
* Remote access via Tailscale
* Multi-VM testing architecture
* AWS cloud deployment projects

Everything here is built, configured, and troubleshooted manually.
